## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the React web frontend application up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
- MongoDB installed and running.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/E-campus-karabuk/React-Web-Front.git
   cd React-Web-Front
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure MongoDB:**
   - Configure the database connection in the `server/config/keys.js` file.

4. **Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm run server
   ```

5. **Run the Client:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

6. **Open in Browser:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

Now you have the React web frontend application running locally. The server will be running on port 5000, and the React app will be running on port 3000. Make sure both are running concurrently for the full functionality of the application.
